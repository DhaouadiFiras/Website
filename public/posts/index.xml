      <description>Subject: Mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of dispersive models by Extended Lagrangians. Advisors: Jean-Paul Vila (PhD advisor), Nicolas Favrie (PhD co-advisor) , Sergey Gavrilyuk (Advisor) Location: This is a joint project between IMT (Toulouse) and IUSTI (Marseille). Defense: It will be held at IMT by the end of 2020 ( to be determined ).  The main motivation The main motivation of my work is to derive a first order hyperbolic system that closely approximates dispersive equations of the Euler-Korteweg type.</description>

      <description>Many phenomena in nature and in our daily lives involve the investigation of waves. It is enough to recall that light travels as an electromagentic wave and that every sound is produced by a wave propagation. And yet, as beautiful and simple it may look to the eye, the investigation of wave dynamics can prove very tricky and may require a considerable amount of mathematical analysis. The main goal of this guide is to provide a decent set of tools and procedures intended to analyze the behavior of strongly nonlinear waves, based on the Withamâ€™s theory of modulation.</description>

      <description>Variational principles When we effortlessly let go of an object, say a tennis ball for example, we instinctively know it will fall straightforwardly to the ground. such a predicition is based on our experience and daily observations. If the ball simply went up instead of falling, this would not feel right, because it was never observed before. This simple exeperience shows that nature is picky: for given circumstances, it does not behave randomly but rather seems to carefully choose one realizable outcome out of all possibilities (at least in classical mechanics).</description>
